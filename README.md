Learning Lean by formalizing simple game theory lemmas.
Nothing serious, just learning Lean

Lemmas so far:

* Every deterministic game without draws has winning strategy for one of the players\[1\]

---

\[1\] The starting point for the proof is assuption that all possible gameplays of a deterministic game can be represented by a finite tree, which I have yet to formalise
